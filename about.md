# Geheim
A simple GD server switcher, used to connect to private servers.

Server swap icon/mod icon by Erymantus/RayDeeUx

## Todo
- Better UI
- Save file syncing to servers (for some reason, this doesn't work)
- Swap server at runtime (currently needs restart, this may be impossible though)
- Multi platform support (yes, even macOS (Blocker: CCHttpRequest not being easy to modify))
- Custom main levels and achievements
- Auto-fetch main levels and achievements on server add and manually (for ones that change the main levels)
- Edit display name and URLs of user-registered servers
